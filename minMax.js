Min & Max in an Array

Implement a function that takes an array 'numbers' and prints out the largest and smallest numbers in that array

Sample outputs 

#1 
Input:
  numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Output:
  minValue = 10
  maxValue = 50

#2 
Input:
  Numbers = [50, 30, 70, 100, 20, 40]
Output:
  minValue = 20
  maxValue = 100

#3 
Input:
  Numbers = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output:
  minValue = 0 
  maxValue = 0

HINT #1: You can assume that the first number in the array is the minimum/maximum number and update it as you iterate through the array
HINT #2: Since the length of the 'numbers' array is unknown, you can find the length of the array using `numbers.length` 

*/

let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
findMinAndMax(numbers);

function findMinAndMax(numbers) {

  //1. Create variables minValue and maxValue to store the minimum and maximum numbers in the array. What should be the starting value of these variables?
  

  //2. Create a for loop to iterate through the numbers array


  //3. Update the values of the minimum and maximum numbers if needed


  //4. Print out the number in the console

}

//5. Test your code using other arrays!
